## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a mathemacical approach that helps us understand how one variable affects another variable.

In the simplest form, we consider two variables, an independent variable and a dependent variable. If the relationship betweend those two variables is a linear relationship, then we can proceed with the linear regression.

Then, we calculate an equation of a line that describes the way that one vriable affects the other variable.

If though the relationship between those two variables is not a linear relationship, which can be revealed by creating a scatter plot, then we cannot use linear regression in this case because we have a non linear relationship.

In a similar way, if more than one independent variables affect our dependent variable (or target variable) in a linear way, then we use multi linear regression.

When we have two independent variables affecting our dependent variable, then the equation of the multi linear regression is the equation a plane in the 3-D axis system.

If though we have more than two independent variables that affect our dependent variable, then the multi linear regression is represented by a hyper plane in the n-th dimensional space.
