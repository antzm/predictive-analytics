## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a mathemacical approach that helps us understand how one variable affects another variable.

In the simplest form, we consider two variables, an independent variable and a dependent variable, and the relationship betweend those variables is a linear relationship.

Then, we calculate an equation of a line that describes the way that one vriable affects the other variable.
